# Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm
## **Deutsch-Jozsa  Problem and Query Complexity**  

## Overview

The **Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm** is a quantum algorithm that solves the **Deutsch-Jozsa problem**. The problem involves determining whether a given function is **constant** or **balanced** using the fewest number of queries. The Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm demonstrates a clear quantum advantage, as it can solve this problem with just **one query** to the oracle, compared to the exponential number of queries required in classical algorithms.

This problem is an example of how quantum computing can provide exponential speedups over classical approaches by leveraging quantum superposition and interference.

## Deutsch-Jozsa Problem

Given a function \( f: \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\} \), the Deutsch-Jozsa problem asks whether the function is:

1. **Constant**: This means that the function outputs the same value (either 0 or 1) for all possible input strings \( x \in \{0, 1\}^n \).
   - Example of constant functions:
     - \( f(x) = 0 \) for all \( x \).
     - \( f(x) = 1 \) for all \( x \).

2. **Balanced**: This means that half of the possible input strings map to 0 and the other half map to 1. For a given \( n \)-bit input, there are \( 2^n \) possible input strings, so exactly half will map to 0 and the other half to 1.
   - Example of balanced functions for \( n = 2 \):
     - \( f(00) = 0, f(01) = 0, f(10) = 1, f(11) = 1 \).
     - \( f(00) = 1, f(01) = 1, f(10) = 0, f(11) = 0 \).

The goal is to determine if \( f \) is constant or balanced with the fewest queries to the oracle that implements this function. 

### Classical Approach

In the **classical case**, it is possible to determine whether the function is constant or balanced by making multiple queries to the function. In the worst-case scenario, you would need to query the function for more than half of the possible input strings to be sure of whether it is constant or balanced. This means that in the worst case, you would need **\( 2^{n-1} + 1 \) queries** to be certain.

### Quantum Approach (Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm)

The **Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm** leverages quantum computing's ability to perform superposition and interference, allowing you to solve the problem with **just one query**. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialize qubits**: We start with \( n+1 \) qubits. The first \( n \) qubits represent the input to the oracle, and the last qubit is an auxiliary qubit initialized to \( |1\rangle \).
2. **Hadamard Transform**: We apply the Hadamard gate to all qubits, creating a superposition of all possible inputs.
3. **Oracle Query**: The oracle is applied to encode the problem’s function \( f \) into the quantum circuit. The oracle will implement either a constant or balanced function.
4. **Second Hadamard Transform**: After the oracle, a second Hadamard transform is applied to the first \( n \) qubits. This creates interference patterns based on the function's outputs.
5. **Measurement**: The first \( n \) qubits are measured. If the function is constant, the measurement will always return 0. If the function is balanced, the measurement will return 1.

This process allows the algorithm to distinguish between constant and balanced functions with just one query, offering an exponential speedup over classical methods.

## Code Implementation

The algorithm is implemented using **Qiskit**, a quantum computing framework, which allows us to simulate quantum circuits and execute quantum algorithms.

## Deutsch-Jozsa Algorithm: Query Complexity

In the context of the **Deutsch-Jozsa problem**, we aim to determine whether a given function \( f: \{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\} \) is **constant** or **balanced** with the fewest queries to an oracle. The complexity of solving this problem is measured in terms of **query complexity**, which refers to the number of queries needed to determine the function type in the worst-case scenario. In this problem, we focus on minimizing the number of queries to the oracle, as all other computational steps (like preprocessing and postprocessing) are considered negligible.

This problem highlights how quantum computing can drastically reduce the number of queries needed compared to classical approaches.

## Query Complexity Analogy

Imagine an oracle as a **wise sage** perched atop a **high mountain**. Every time you need to ask a question, you must hike up the mountain to inquire. Since the journey to the top is difficult and time-consuming, it’s essential to minimize the number of trips to the oracle. Each time you ask a question (a query), it counts as one journey, so the focus is on reducing the number of queries.

The goal of the **Deutsch-Jozsa problem** is to figure out whether the function provided by the oracle is **constant** (always outputs the same value) or **balanced** (half of the inputs map to 0 and the other half to 1). We aim to minimize the number of queries to figure this out, ensuring that we don’t waste unnecessary trips.

## Classical Query Complexity

In the **classical case**, the oracle takes an input \( i \in \{0, 1\}^n \) and outputs \( f(i) \in \{0, 1\} \). The task is to determine whether the function \( f \) is constant or balanced by making a series of queries.

Here’s how the classical approach works:

- If we query the oracle once, say by checking \( f(0) \), we can't be sure if the function is constant or balanced. A single query only provides information about one input.
  
- If we query the oracle twice, checking both \( f(0) \) and \( f(1) \), we can determine whether the function is constant or balanced:
  - If \( f(0) = f(1) \), the function is **constant**.
  - If \( f(0) \neq f(1) \), the function is **balanced**.

Thus, the classical query complexity of the Deutsch-Jozsa problem is **two queries**. With these two queries, we can determine the nature of the function with certainty.

### Classical Example

Let’s consider an example with \( n = 1 \):
- We have the oracle that either implements a constant or balanced function.
- We query the oracle twice, once with \( f(0) \) and once with \( f(1) \):
  - If the answers are the same (both 0 or both 1), the function is constant.
  - If the answers differ (one is 0, the other is 1), the function is balanced.

This method requires a minimum of two queries to guarantee the correct determination.

## Quantum Advantage

The **quantum approach** offers a **significant speedup** over the classical method. Instead of querying the oracle multiple times, **quantum computing** enables us to determine whether the function is constant or balanced with just **one query**.

### Quantum Query Complexity

The **Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm** leverages quantum superposition and interference to solve the problem efficiently. Here’s how it works:

- A quantum circuit is initialized with \( n + 1 \) qubits. The first \( n \) qubits represent the function's input, and the last qubit is an auxiliary qubit.
- We apply a **Hadamard transform** to all qubits to create a superposition of all possible inputs.
- The oracle is applied, encoding the function \( f \) into the quantum state.
- A second **Hadamard transform** is applied to the first \( n \) qubits, creating interference patterns based on the outputs of the function.
- Finally, a measurement is performed on the first \( n \) qubits. If the result is \( 0 \), the function is constant; if the result is \( 1 \), the function is balanced.

With this quantum approach, we only need to make **one query** to the oracle to determine whether the function is constant or balanced, offering an **exponential speedup** over the classical method.
